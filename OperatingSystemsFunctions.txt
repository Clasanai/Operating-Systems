The operating system has an important function that works to be able to run multiple applications at one time. It can send information to hardware, and while waiting for that hardware to perform the action, it can move onto another action. Then, when the hardware signals that it is done with the task, it can return to that process and continue any actions needed.
An operating system also works to manage the memory in a computer. It allocates memory to different programs that are running at one time. It also makes sure that those programs have easy and sequential access to memory, to avoid crashes and bugs.
